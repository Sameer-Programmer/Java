3.DataTypes, 
4.Declaration, 
5.Initialization 
6.conditional Statements
7.Loops- for, while, do-while 
8.Jump statements - continue, break
9.class, method, Objects

# inheritance 

* 1.inheritance - single 
  2.inheritance - Multi-level 
  3.Hierarchical inheritance
  4.Multiple-inheritance 
  5.Hybrid - Combination of Hierarchial and Multiple inheritance 
# Polymorphism 
Method Overriding
Run time Polymorphism 
# Abstraction 
class name Starts with Abstract keyword 
It Contains Abstract methods 
we can not create objects with the class - we can create Objects with the help of subclass 
# Encapsulation 
Encapsulation is achieved by making class Variables  private - To access these Variables in other class we through to use get() method and to set the Values we have to use  set() Method.
# Strings
1. length of the string
2. concatenation
3. equals keyword
# this keyword
To differentiate local and Instance variables - Especially when using a Constructor
# super_keyword
 Super keyword we can use for 
 * 1. For Printing Instance Variable
   2. for calling methods
   3. for Calling Constructor.
* Calling instance Variable of Parent class to the immediate subclass
1. we have to use inside  the print statement ---signature super.varialename;
2. we can use super keyword  for to call in the Parent class method to the subclass method - we should use indside the subclass method only.
3. we can super-Keyword to call the Constructor of Superclass to immediate subclass by signature super ();-- we should use this one inside the Subclass Constructor only
4. suppose if we have the method , Constructor  in the parent class , To implement these  we should write Constructor part first , them only we have to implement method
