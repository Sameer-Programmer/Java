# Java
Basic-Core -Java Programs
1. Simple -Hello World Programme,
2. variables,
3.DataTypes, 
4. Declaration, 
5. Initialization 
6. conditional Statements
7. Loops- for, while, do-while 
8. Jump statements - continue, break
9. class, method, Objects 
10. Method Overloading 
11. Constructor
12. Constructor -Overloading 
# inheritance 
1. inheritance - single 
2. inheritance - Multi-level 
3. Hierarchical inheritance
4. Multiple-inheritance 
5. Hybrid - Combination of Hierarchial and Multiple inheritance 
# Polymorphism 
Method Overriding
Run time Polymorphism 
# Abstraction 
class name Starts with the Abstract keyword 
It Contains Abstract methods 
we can not create objects with the class - we can create Objects with the help of subclass 
# Encapsulation 
Encapsulation is achieved by making class Variables  private - To access these Variables in other classes we through to use get() method and to set the Values we have to use  the set() Method.
# Strings
1. length of the string
2. concatenation
3. equals keyword
# this keyword
To differentiate local and Instance variables - Especially when using a Constructor
# super_keyword
 The super keyword we can use for 
 * 1. For Printing Instance Variable
   2. for calling methods
   3. for Calling Constructor.
* Calling instance Variable of the Parent class to the immediate subclass
1. we have to use inside  the print statement ---signature super. variable name;
2. we can use the super keyword  to call in the Parent class method to the subclass method - we should use it inside the subclass method only.
3. we can super-Keyword to call the Constructor of Superclass to immediate subclass by signature super ();-- we should use this one inside the Subclass Constructor only
4. suppose we have the method, Constructor  in the parent class, To implement this  we should write the Constructor part first, then only we have to implement the method.
