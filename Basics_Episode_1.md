# Types of Programming Languages

1. **Structured**  
   - **Example:** C  
   - Does not support Object-Oriented Programming  

2. **Object-Based**  
   - **Examples:** VB, VBScript  
   - Supports classes and objects but does not support inheritance and polymorphism  

3. **Object-Oriented**  
   - **Examples:** C++, Java, C#, Python  
   - Supports Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation


     ## Note
      Python is the all-rounder; it supports all programming Language

     # Java
     ## Features of Java
     1. Platform independent
     2. Case sensitive
    
     ## Components of Java
   - JDK: Java Development Kit
   - JRE: Java Runtime Environment
   - JVM: Java Virtual Machine
  
4. ## Components of Java

### 1. JDK (Java Development Kit)  
- A complete package for **Java development**.  
- Includes **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment) + **compilers** + **debugging tools**.  
- Used by developers to **write, compile, and run** Java programs.  

### 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)  
- Used when you **only want to run** Java applications but not develop them.
-  Provides the necessary libraries and environment to **run** Java programs
- Includes the **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) and core libraries.  


### 3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)  
- The **engine** that runs Java applications.  
- Converts Java bytecode into machine code **(specific to the OS)**.  
- Ensures Java's **platform independence** (Write Once, Run Anywhere).  

### **Summary:**  
- **JDK** = JRE + Development tools (for coding)  
- **JRE** = JVM + Libraries (for running Java programs)  
- **JVM** = Executes Java bytecode

- ## Who Converts Source Code to Bytecode?

The **Java Compiler (javac)** is responsible for converting **source code** (written in `.java` files) into **bytecode** (stored in `.class` files).

### **Process:**
1. The developer writes Java code in a `.java` file.  
2. The **javac (Java Compiler)** compiles the source code into **bytecode** (`.class` file).  
3. The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** then executes this bytecode.  

### **Key Points**
- The Java compiler is part of the **JDK (Java Development Kit)**.  
- Bytecode is **platform-independent**, meaning it can run on any system with a compatible **JVM**.
