---To Represent Group of Elements ------
Conditions

1.-Insertion Order is Not preserved
1.Duplicates are Not allowed

we Have a concept called Hashcode -- by this concept we will be inserted elements into Hashset
Advantage
 Searching will be faster
 There is no concept of index in Hashset -- Elements are arranged in Random order
 Heterogenious will be Supported
 Nulls also supported
 ===============================================
 How many Ways We can Create Hashset Object
Declaration of Hashset
Hashset hashset = new Hashset();

By default it will allocate 16 Allocations ----intial size is 16

we have one more thing In Hashset ----------Loadfactor or we can call it has  Fill ratio
Fill ratio of Hashmap has Default value --- 0.75 -- called percentage

when ever storing Elements  will reach  to 75 percentage ,
New Object is Created in Hashset with new storage , the Old Object will reach to Garbage collection

we can configure intial size and Fill ratio -- if we want more and Justify
Hashset hs = new Hashset(100);      // Here am Providing initial size as 100;
Hashset hs = new  Hashset(100, 0.90); // Here am Providing initial size as 100 and Fill ratio as 0.90;
 The above is for Heterogenious data

 To store  elements for Homogenious Data
 Hashset <Integers> hashset  = new Hashset<Integers>();

 Special - Methods     No Special methods in Hashset
  Only the methods present in set interface only present in Hashset ---- But No special methods

add (value)
addAll(collection)
remove(value)
removeAll(collection)
 contain(object)
 containsAll( group of Objects)
 isEmpty()

 Note: Sorting and shuffling not directly Possible in Hashset  because Here Elements are in Random Order
