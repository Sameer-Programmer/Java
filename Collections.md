# Collections
Definition-- Group of objects -- is called Collection
A collection is a single Entity - Representing Multiple Objects

# Collection FrameWork

1. In Java - To Represent Multiple -Objects in a single entity -- we need Classes and interfaces -- So the collection framework will provide us with these Classes and Object
2. Collection Framework contains n number of Classes and Interfaces 

# Limitations Of Array 
1. Arrays are  Not Growable -- They are fixed - At the Run time, we can-not Increase and Decrease the Array.
2. In Array, we are able to store only Homogeneous Data 
3. Arrays are not implemented without any Under-Lying  Data Structures  or Readymade Methods not available-- for Example -- sorting an array, finding duplicates, etc

# Advantages of Collections
* Collections are growable
* At the Run-time we can add elements
* In Collections, we are able to store only Homogeneous Data + HeteroGenious Data - Different data type Elements Store we can store here
* Collections are implemented  with  Under-Lying  Data Structures  or Readymade Methods available-


# let's talk about the Interfaces in Collection 
* Collection (I) -------  It is a Root Interface in our Words we can call it has Parent Interface 
* Collections -- In Java, which is a #Pre-defined class -- from Java.utils- package
* This Collections class contains a certain number of methods --Those methods we can use to perform Certain Operations on Collection Object.

Collection Interface contains 3 Child interfaces 
* 1.List -----interface 
* 2.set ------interface
* 3.Queue -----interface

# List 
1. List is a Collection, where we store the group of elements we go for List---
2. when the insertion is Allowed, Duplicates are allowed we go with the List -----interface
3. List interface is implemented with different classes
4. a. Array List --- class
5. b. Linked List ---- Class
6. c. Vector -- This is we have something -- This is also another Kind of Collection -- This is extended from the Stack
7. This Vector and Stack are called Legacy Classes in Java
